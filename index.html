    <p>Hello! My name is Anna Schwartz and I am from Las Vegas, Nevada. I am majoring in Interdiscplinary Studies and plan to become a teacher. A career in web design would actually be a lot more fun than I give it credit for. You get to use creativity, as well as, your computer skills. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church since birth. My favorite scipture is Philippians 4:13 and one of my favorite quotes is from Sister Wright as she states that we need to infuse the Light of Jesus Christ into every corner of our lives. I enjoy hanging out with my puggle, Ginger, and playing video games. Right now, I just finished The Last of Us on Survivor mode - kinda proud. Anyways, super excited to work through this class with you guys! </p>
